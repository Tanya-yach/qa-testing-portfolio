# QA Testing Portfolio â€“ Tetiana Yachna

Welcome to my testing portfolio! This repository showcases my work in software quality assurance across various testing disciplines.
The main goal is to simulate real QA tasks and showcase the skills required for a Software Development Engineer in Test role.

## Repository Structure

### ðŸ“‚ manual-testing-luxor
Manual testing project based on the real e-commerce website **[Luxor.cz](https://www.luxor.cz/)**.  
Includes test documentation for functional and UI testing. All bug reports are fictional and created for demonstration purposes.
Artifacts for web testing:
- Test Plan (`test-plan.md`)
- Test Scenarios (`test-scenarios.md`)
- Test Cases (`test-cases.md`)
- Checklists (`checklist.md`)
- Bug Reports (`bug-report.md`)

---

### ðŸ“‚ api-testing-luxor (Mock API)
Since there is no public API for **[Luxor.cz](https://www.luxor.cz/)**, all endpoints were designed based on assumptions and simulated using a **Postman Mock Server**.
API testing artifacts:
- Test Plan (`test-plan-api.md`)
- Test Cases (`test-cases-api.md`)
- Postman Collection (`postman-collection-api.json`) with pre-configured mock examples
- Bug Reports (`bug-report-api.md`)

---

### ðŸ“‚ api-testing-restful_booker
This project includes automated API tests using [RESTful Booker API](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/).
API testing artifacts:
- Postman Collection (`restful_booker-postman-collection-api.json`) full set of requests and scripts
- CSV Test Data (`bookings_data.csv`) 20 rows of booking data generated via [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com)
- Environment file (`Restful-Booker_env.json`) stores base URL and dynamic token
- Newman HTML Report (`newman-report/Restful-Booker-Report.html`) automatically generated report after test execution

**Key Features:**
- Token-based authentication (handled via scripts)
- Create / Update / Partial Update / Delete booking endpoints tested
- Data-driven testing using CSV as source
- Assertions for each API response
- Chained requests using environment variables
- Negative scenarios tested (e.g. unauthorized updates)
- HTML report for visual test results


---

### ðŸ“‚ performance-testing-restful_booker
Performance testing project for [RESTful Booker API](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/) using JMeter.
Includes different types of performance tests:
- Load Testing: Simulates normal and peak load conditions (`LoadTest.jmx`)
- Smoke Testing: Verifies basic performance under minimal load (`SmokeTest.jmx`)
- Soak Testing: Checks system stability under sustained load (planned `SoakTest.jmx`)
- Stress Testing: Identifies breaking points (planned `MiniStressTest.jmx`)

Project structure:
- `/api` - Contains API specifications and test data
- `/results` - Stores generated test reports and performance metrics
- Test scripts (`*.jmx`) - Ready-to-run JMeter test plans
- Performance analysis reports in HTML/CSV formats
