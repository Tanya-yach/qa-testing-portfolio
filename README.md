# QA Testing Portfolio â€“ Tetiana Yachna

Welcome to my testing portfolio! This repository showcases my work in software quality assurance across various testing disciplines.
The main goal is to simulate real QA tasks and showcase the skills required for a Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) role.

## Repository Structure

### ðŸ“‚ Manual Testing
Manual testing project based on the real e-commerce website **[Luxor.cz](https://www.luxor.cz/)**.  
Includes test documentation for functional and UI testing. 
Artifacts for web testing:
- Test Plan
- Test Scenarios
- Test Cases
- Checklists
- Bug Reports (mock examples, coming soon)

### ðŸ“‚ API Testing
Since there is no public API for **[Luxor.cz](https://www.luxor.cz/)**, all endpoints were designed based on assumptions and simulated using a **Postman Mock Server**.
API testing artifacts:
- Test Plan
- Test Cases
- Postman Collection (JSON) with pre-configured mock examples
- Bug Reports (coming soon)
- Additional collection for educational API (e.g., qademo) - planned
